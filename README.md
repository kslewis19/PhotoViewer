# PhotoViewer
This java program uses the Swing UI kit to showcase to sample photos, which happen to be beautiful stock images of dogs.


*The development of this project has been long-delayed, and this project was published only to display Java and Swing fundamentals. Because of this, some features currently only work with the stock images provided*

**Features:**

- each photo can be rated on a scale 1 through 5

- photos can be sorted by user ratings and predetermined upload dates

- thumbnails can be clicked for easy transition between photos
